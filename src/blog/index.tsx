                    I have a medical condition, and it's called "having knees". If anyone knows of a cure, please let me know. I managed 
                    to tweak a hamstring while exercising, the thing I am supposed to do to keep my knees healthy. Knees, man.
                    Can't live with them, can't delete them from existence and walk around with really long straight stick legs. 
                    Starting to think climbing out of the water 375 million years ago was a mistake

                    Let's keep the mewithoutyou train going with today's Song of the Day, <i>The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie</i>. This song recounts an old aesop's fable, 
                    and it's one of my favorites! I particularly like the bird puns

                    I have a website! You remember websites, don't you? The modern web seems to be increasingly condensed
                    into just a few social media sites owned by an even fewer number of companies. But, that doesn't 
                    mean the 'old web' has to die. After all, anyone can make their own website! In particular, <a href="https://neocities.org">neocities.org</a> seems super cool. That's where I would have made my
                    website if I didn't do it on AWS. Long live the old web!

                    I intend to use this space as a journal to record my thoughts and post my hilarious jokes. It's more for me 
                    than anyone else but if you are here then hello!
