                    That is to say, the keychains for my kickstarter have arrived at long last! Thank you to everyone who got one, I will be mailing
                    them out shortly or just handing them to you in person, because if you are reading this chances are you are probably one of my friends. 
                    I can now say I have run a successful kickstarter campaign....... even if I had some help (thanks Mom)

                    Praise the library! Scanners, printers, and books, all free for anyone!
                    I finally made it down to scan in some artwork,
                    do enjoy this very realistic drawing of my cat

                    I've also updated my landing page with a self-portrait. I hate to choose 
                    a picture with a mask over my face but it is truly the best picture I 
                    could find of myself. Also faces are hard to draw so that kinda worked out.
                    The cat is a little fella from the cat shelter named Stripe, a total shoulder-cat!.

                    Today's Song of the Day is "A Sadness Runs Through Him" by The Hoosiers. I can't stop listening to it, mostly because of the 
                    beautiful vocals. The version I like isn't on bandcamp but please enjoy the acoustic version!

                    I have a medical condition, and it's called "having knees". If anyone knows of a cure, please let me know. I managed 
                    to tweak a hamstring while exercising, the thing I am supposed to do to keep my knees healthy. Knees, man.
                    Can't live with them, can't delete them from existence and walk around with really long straight stick legs. 
                    Starting to think climbing out of the water 375 million years ago was a mistake

                    Let's keep the mewithoutyou train going with today's Song of the Day, "The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie". This song recounts an old aesop's fable, 
                    and it's one of my favorites! I particularly like the bird puns

                    I have a website! You remember websites, don't you? The modern web seems to be increasingly condensed
                    into just a few social media sites owned by an even fewer number of companies. But, that doesn't 
                    mean the 'old web' has to die. After all, anyone can make their own website! In particular, <a href="https://neocities.org">neocities.org</a> seems super cool. That's where I would have made my
                    website if I didn't do it on AWS. Long live the old web!
